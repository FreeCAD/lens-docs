Ondsel Lens supports customizing parametric FreeCAD models created using the VarSets system. Custom properties created with VarSets are called model attributes on Lens.

An example of a parametric model would be this simple gridfinity implementation where users can customize the model by setting the number of rows and columns:

Users or Lens can access such a model and change the same properties:
